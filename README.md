This [first neural network implementation](https://github.com/JordanPottruff/neural-networks/blob/master/src/main/java/com/github/jordanpottruff/neural/models/BackPropNetwork.java "Java Code") is a simple multilayer perceptron (MLP) trained with backpropagation. The network is highly configurable and accepts user-defined activation functions, weight initialization schemes, and layer size definitions. Click the 'see it in action' link above to see a simple web application that uses trained network weights to recognize digits written by the user.
